## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/dWsxVm1/1.png)

I am learning frontend development and to reinforce what I learned, I decided to write a pet-project that will work with api github. 

As an idea of the project I decided to search for repositories and save repositories I like locally on my computer, to further display these repositories on the site.

## Usage

To search for repositories, perform the following steps:
* To search for repositories, enter a query in the search field and press the "Enter" button or the "search" button.
* To save a repository, click on the "save" button located in the repository card you want to save.

There are two ways to delete a saved repository:
* Click again on the "save" button in the repository card you want to remove.
* Open the list of saved repositories and click on the delete button of the card you want to delete.
